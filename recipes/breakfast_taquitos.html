        <p>These vegetarian breakfast taquitos are filled with mushrooms and kale and make a great start to the day.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped cremini mushrooms</li>
            <li>3/4 cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped kale leaves</li>
            <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>4 egg whites, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese with jalape√±os</li>
            <li>1 (4-ounce) can green chiles, undrained</li>
            <li>8 (6-inch) whole wheat flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1/4 cup salsa</li>
            <li>optional toppers: Mexican crema, chopped fresh cilantro, sliced green onions, and/or chopped black olives</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet heat over medium heat. Add mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion; cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add kale. Cook and stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Remove from skillet.</li>
            <li>Add eggs and egg whites to the hot skillet. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on the bottom and around the edges. With a spatula, lift and fold the partially cooked egg mixture so the uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking until egg mixture is cooked through but still glossy and moist, 2 to 3 minutes. Return vegetable mixture to skillet with cheese and chiles; stir gently to combine.</li>
            <li>Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup filling; roll up as tightly as possible. Arrange taquitos, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each. Brush evenly with remaining 3 teaspoons oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until evenly browned and crispy, about 15 minutes or. Serve with salsa and, if desired, toppers.</li>

        </ol>
